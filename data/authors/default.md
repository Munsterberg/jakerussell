### Hi there!

I am currently a senior software engineer at [Linus](https://getlinus.io), connecting user funds to
borrowers in digital asset credit markets. For information on my work here, you can read a fancy
[blog post](https://medium.com/the-linus-blog/getting-to-know-linus-jake-russell-f1da0601b215).

I've been fortunate to work for a variety of other organizations, including [Savvy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/savvyio/about/), [SimpleLease](https://simplelease.co/), [LabX Media Group](http://www.labxmediagroup.com/), and [Jailyard](https://jailyard.com). I have a passion for growing startups, and most recently have found myself in opportune positions that leverage DeFi.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading/studying philosophy, psychology, and have recently become obsessed
with golf. You can find me rolling on BJJ mats, or a putting green.
