Remote positions are becoming more readily available, so why not adapt and land one?

I get asked questions online quite a bit, but when people in my “real-life circle” ask me something, I know I should write about it. It seems everyone wants to work from home nowadays, or pursue the highly coveted digital nomad lifestyle. What’s even weirder, is when I would tell a family friend that was visiting that I worked from home, they would drool over it like I was some sort of celebrity.

I figure it’s time to make a short guide on how I would approach landing a remote position now. I’m going to omit all the other necessary logistics that one should ponder before pursuing this lifestyle, such as creating a workspace, learning to communicate effectively, and optimizing ones workflow.

**Learn new technologies.** When React began picking up steam, I decided to jump on board and learn it as my first front-end JavaScript framework. I briefly spoke about this in a previous blog post, but I didn’t mention the correlation between modern technologies and remote positions.

Remote work is a new emerging way for companies to hire employees that are able to work from home (or anywhere for that matter) — keyword being ‘new’. It is a very forward thinking way of hiring talent. I’m not going to claim that remote positions are the way of the future (although I do believe this), but the internet and modern tools makes these positions much more readily available than previously.

Due to these positions being ‘new’, newer technologies sort of go hand in hand with them. Obviously this doesn’t apply to all positions, but a lot I came across required modern web tools and frameworks. Keep in mind this was my own personal experience, by the time you’re reading this, and depending on where you’re from, the results could vary.

**Show that you can work in a team environment.** When I first started programming I immersed myself in a few related communities, one being FreeCodeCamp. During my journey I made several friends that would work on projects with me. We would use gitlab to collaborate on projects, trello/asana to manage them, and slack to communicate. These are tools (or similar) that are being used by remote workers every day.

If you can prove that you have experience using these tools and technologies, that gives you a massive advantage. During my interview with my first remote position (also my first dev related job), I showed them one of the projects I was working on with 2 others. They looked over the repo, our trello board, and even asked what we used to communicate. This went a long way in securing the position.

**It’s not as hard as you may think.** Most folks are still coming to terms with this as a possibility. Just do a few google searches regarding remote work and most will return one of the following: “You must be a senior!” “It pays peanuts.” “You won’t fit in with the team.” I read all of this, and to be quite honest, all of it was bullshit. My very first dev related job was remote, I got paid above average, and I fit in great and remain friends with some of my former co-workers.

You just have to get out there and start looking. Apply for every position, at best you’ll get the job, at worse you’ll get experience. As always, forget the naysayers. I, and many others have done it, you most certainly can too.
